Student Performance & Course Recommendation System
A comprehensive database-driven analytics system that provides intelligent course recommendations and performance insights for academic institutions.
🎯 Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced SQL concepts including joins, aggregations, window functions, recursive CTEs, and triggers to build a complete student performance analytics and course recommendation system.
🏗️ Architecture & Database Design
Core Components

MySQL Database with 9 interconnected tables
Advanced SQL Analytics using window functions and recursive CTEs
Automated Triggers for real-time GPA updates
Interactive Dashboard for data visualization
Intelligent Recommendation Engine

Database Schema
sql- departments (5 departments)
- students (15 active students)
- courses (20+ courses across departments)
- course_prerequisites (prerequisite chains)
- enrollments (current and historical)
- exams (various assessment types)
- student_exam_results (detailed performance)
- course_grades (final course outcomes)
- student_recommendations (AI-driven suggestions)
🚀 Key Features
1. Advanced SQL Analytics

Window Functions: Rank students by GPA within departments
Recursive CTEs: Build complete course prerequisite chains
Complex Joins: Multi-table performance analysis
Aggregations: Department-level performance metrics

2. Automated Systems

Triggers: Auto-update student GPA when grades are inserted/updated
Stored Procedures: Generate personalized course recommendations
Data Integrity: Foreign key constraints and validation

3. Intelligent Recommendations

GPA-based course difficulty matching
Prerequisite validation
Department alignment scoring
Performance trend analysis

4. Interactive Dashboard

Real-time performance metrics
Department performance heatmap
Student ranking and progress tracking
Course success rate visualization

📊 Sample Analytics Queries
Student Rankings by Department
sqlSELECT 
    s.student_name,
    d.department_name,
    s.current_gpa,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.department_id ORDER BY s.current_gpa DESC) as dept_rank
FROM students s
JOIN departments d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY d.department_name, dept_rank;
Prerequisite Chain Analysis
sqlWITH RECURSIVE PrerequisiteChain AS (
    SELECT course_id, course_name, prerequisite_course_id, 1 as level_depth
    FROM courses c
    LEFT JOIN course_prerequisites cp ON c.course_id = cp.course_id
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT prc.course_id, prc.course_name, cp2.prerequisite_course_id, 
           prc.level_depth + 1
    FROM PrerequisiteChain prc
    JOIN course_prerequisites cp2 ON prc.prerequisite_course_id = cp2.course_id
    WHERE prc.level_depth < 5
)
SELECT * FROM PrerequisiteChain ORDER BY course_id, level_depth;
🎯 Key Deliverables
1. Next Recommended Course for Each Student
The system generates personalized course recommendations based on:

Current GPA and academic performance
Completed prerequisite courses
Department alignment
Course difficulty progression

2. Department Performance Heatmap
Visual representation showing:

Average grades by department and difficulty level
Grade distribution analysis
Performance categories (Excellent, Good, Average, Needs Improvement)
Student success rates
